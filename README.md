# Coding-Exercise-1
# Design Rationale:

Sketch: public/sketch.jpg

I chose to use these variables to show either relative increases or decreases in protected regions.
Colour doesn't really encode anything, so long as the contrast is good against the background it could be any colour. 
Opacity is set to 0.8 so that circles may be seen behind other circles.

I included a dashed line at x = y for a better comparison of where countries fall relative to remaining even with the previous amount of protected land, so a viewer may better understand changes.
